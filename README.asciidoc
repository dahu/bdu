correctly by size and (if supercat is available) coloured by magnitude.

* The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_(Unix)[du] system tool
* http://www.newlisp.org/[newLISP]
* http://supercat.nosredna.net/[Supercat Text Colorizer] [optional]

=== Usage

.Show file sizes in increasing order for all files in the current directory:

  bdu

.Show file sizes in increasing order for all ++png++ files in the current directory:

  bdu *.png

NOTE: Quote the glob if there are filenames containing special characters.

=== Install

  > cp bin/* ~/bin/

__Or__ to a valid, writeable directory in your ++$PATH++

==== Coloured Output

If you have the http://supercat.nosredna.net/[supercat] tool (++spc++)

  > cp spcrc/spcrc-bdu ~/.spcrc/
